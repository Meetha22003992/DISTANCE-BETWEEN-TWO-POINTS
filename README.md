# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two two points
## ALGORITHM:
1. Import math module 
2. Create the list from the given points and formula 
3. Use the formula d=√((x_2-x_1)²+(y_2-y_1)²) to find the distane between two points 
4. Use math.sqrt for the square root and calculate the distance between the given points
5. Print the calculates distance for 2 decimals
### PROGRAM:

import math
d1=[4,2]
d2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((d2[0]-d1[0])**2+(d2[1]-d1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```  
### OUTPUT:
![distance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119401038/225204270-60944441-00ab-43cc-a615-4dbfbc420b20.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using python programming.
